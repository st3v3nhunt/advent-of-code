# Rust solution attempts

## Setup

Each day is its own crate. Because a crate can not have a name starting with
the numeric character each day is spelt e.g. day 1 is `one`, day 20 is
`twenty`.

### Running

[cargo-watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch) is used to help with
running the solutions. See the link for additional information on installing
and detailed usage. Basic use is achieved with `cargo watch -x run` in the
directory of the day being worked on.
