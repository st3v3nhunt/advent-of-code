# JavaScript solution attempts

## Setup

Make a copy of the `x` directory and rename it for the day e.g. from the `js`
directory run `cp -r x 1`, for day `1`. Update any `TODO` within the file.

### Running

Run `node x/main.ts` (where `x` is the day number) from the `js` directory.
Alternatively run `npx nodemon x/main.js` (where `x` is the number of the day
to run). This approach uses [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx)
to run [nodemon](https://nodemon.io).
