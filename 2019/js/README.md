# [Advent of code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/)

## Getting started

An npm script is available to run which will execute the given day's code i.e.
`npm run day <X>`. It will also time the execution of each function and report
to the console.

The script assumes there is a directory named `<X>` e.g. `24`. In the directory
there _must_ be a module called `main.js`. The module must export 2 functions
with the names `part1` and `part2`. Each function should return a string. The
string will be printed to the console.

### Template

There is a templated folder available which can be copied and renamed to the
day required. The folder is called `[X](X)`.
